# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLO and OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model and OpenCV. The YOLO model is capable of detecting multiple objects in images and videos with high accuracy and speed.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using the YOLO model.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected objects.
- Labels objects with class names and confidence scores.
- Removes redundant detections using non-maximum suppression.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- YOLO configuration and weights files (e.g., `yolov3.cfg` and `yolov3.weights`)
- COCO class names file (`coco.names`)
